== README

This project is called - my_sports_stat_tracker - June 2016

It is an app that will allow a user to sign in (from a mobile device, desktop, or laptop). They will have a number of choices, eventually. Initially, however; the focus will be on building out the stat tracking portion. The user will be able to keep stats for a team (flag football, in this case).

I will add more documentation in the near future. For now, I am building my Ruby environment and getting started on this masterpiece!

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version
  2.3.1
