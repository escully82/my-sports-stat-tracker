This project is called - my_sports_stat_tracker - June 2016

It is an app that will allow a user to sign in (from a mobile device, desktop, or laptop). They will have a number of choices, eventually. Initially, however; the focus will be on building out the stat tracking portion. The user will be able to keep stats for a team (flag football, in this case).

I will add more documentation in the near future. For now, I am building my Ruby environment and getting started on this masterpiece!

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
